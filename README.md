===========

This is me, walking through the GitHub introduction.

This file will contain some information pretaining to the project so readers may be more intune with what the goals, requirements and outcomes will be. 

I am walking through the GitHub starting turorial and getting a "lay of the land".

Boooyah.

Now look, I'm editing the readme in a new branch. I'm going to say nothing more.
