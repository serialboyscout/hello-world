hello-world
===========

This is me, walking through the GitHub introduction.

This file will contain some information pretaining to the project so readers may be more intune with what the goals, requirements and outcomes will be. 

I am walking through the GitHub starting turorial and getting a "lay of the land".

Boooyah.

Now look, I'm editing the readme in a new branch. I'm going to say nothing more.

Now I'm making some edits from Eclipse on my local Git Repository. I'm going to try and merge this branch with the master. Sweet, huh?

I'm updating the README yet again because I need to double check the process for committing to Github. Also, neither of these updates was a new branch merge.
